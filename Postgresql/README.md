This directory contains SQL files needed to build Domestik's database environment in a PostgreSQL database.

Common.sql defines the Domestik environment and owns tables, and is MANDATORY. It has to be installed first.

*.sql declares objects for each probe. You may refine them to the ones you're using ... (obviously, it's harmless to install everything).
